# Submitting a GAP

When you're ready, use the following procedures to submit your draft proposal by creating a pull request in GitHub.

1. Use a template to ensure your proposal includes all the required information.
   * [ ] Click the [template](https://github.com/swarmfund/networkgovernance/tree/master/templates) that relates to the proposal you are submitting,
   * [ ] To copy the template, click **Raw**, then copy the contents of the template to use in your proposal in the next step. &#x20;
2. Submit your draft proposal:
   * [ ] In the [GAPs](https://github.com/swarmfund/networkgovernance/tree/master/GAPs) repository, **create a new file**.
   * [ ] Name your proposal with a temporary name in the following format:  **GAP\_\[CURRENT\_EPOCH\_TIME]\_\[NAME].md**  For example:  **GAP\_1565084743\_SAMPLENAME.md**  Epoch Time may be obtained from [https://www.epochconverter.com](https://www.epochconverter.com)&#x20;
   * [ ] Paste the contents of the template from Step 1 into your file and complete all the information.
   * [ ] Select the option to "**Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.**"
   * [ ] Click "**Propose new file**" to review your submission, add any comments or notes, and click "**Create pull request**" to continue.
3. Stake 250 SWM to make your proposal eligible for balloting.
   * [ ] An editor will reply to your request, providing an address to stake at least 250 SWM.
   * [ ] Deposit your stake and provide the TransactionID for verification. Eligible proposals will be merged and be visible in the [GAPs](https://github.com/swarmfund/networkgovernance/tree/master/GAPs) repository.
   * [ ] Any Swarm Member may improve the likelihood of the GAP being balloted by staking an additional amount of SWM, in increments of at least 250.
